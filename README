This repository contains OpenSCAD models of various interior control knobs for a
2004 Chevrolet Astro. For obvious reasons the selection is biased towards those
that tend to break at around ($PRESENT_YEAR - 2004) years. It seems likely that
at least some of these will fit other GM vehicles of the late '90s and early
'00s, probably biased towards the earlier end of that range (the Astro interior
was an old design by 2004). See comments in the individual source files for
details on what they are.
